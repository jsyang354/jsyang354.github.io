										<h2>Sports</h2>
									</header>
									<p>It's all about "SPORTS". Thanks to my dad, who used to be a high school P.E. teacher in Korea, sports were always around me. Until now, sports have been a part of my life, and I like to do sports-related activities such as watching, playing, and going to a game whenever I have time or get stressed out!</p>

												<h3>Soccer</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Among all ball games, soccer is my most favorite one. I love watching and playing both computer and actual game! I have been playing soccer since elementary school, and now I enjoy playing soccer with my teammates here in UIUC as well.</p>

												<h3>Baseball</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Baseball was the first ball game I have ever played and also one of my favorite sports. There was a ballpark near my home and I often went there with my dad. Watching 'Moneyball' was one of the game changers in my life that made me to have an interest in sports and statistics (sabermetrics).</p>

												<h3>Basketball</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Although I have recently started to watch basketball, it is somewhat more exciting to watch the game than I expected. The atmosphere that I have experienced in the stadium was new, and the overall game tempo is much faster than soccer or baseball, makes me more thrilled!</p>
